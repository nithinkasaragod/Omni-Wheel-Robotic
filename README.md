Project: Pick and Place Robotic Arm Robot

1. Introduction
A Pick and Place Robot is a robotic arm that picks up items from one place and drops them in another. Such robots find extensive use in manufacturing, assembly lines, packaging, warehouses, and automation systems.
Here you are creating a mobile robotic arm with Arduino UNO as the central controller, Bluetooth for wireless control, and ESP32-CAM for vision assistance.

2. Components Utilized
* Arduino UNO – Microcontroller board for regulating the whole robot.
* Motor Driver L298N/L293D – To power the DC motors (N20 motors for wheels).
* Bluetooth Module (HC-05/HC-06) – For wireless remote control using a smartphone.
* ESP32-CAM – Offers live video streaming for surveillance and object detection.
* Servo Motor SG90 (x4 or x5) – To operate the robotic arm joints (base, shoulder, elbow, gripper).
* N20 Motors (with gearbox) – Used for rotating the omni wheels for robot motion.
* Omni Wheels – Enable smooth movement in any direction (forward, backward, sideways).
* Lithium-ion Battery (18650 cells) – Power source for robot and motors.
* PCB Board (custom designed) – Used for clean connections of components.
* Acrylic Sheet Base – Strong and light base for placing components.
* 3D Printed Parts – For robotic arm structure, gripper, and motor holders.
* Fusion 360 Design – To design robot body, arm joints, and chassis.

3. Working Principle

Robot Movement (Mobile Base):
The N20 motors with omni wheels support movement in all directions.
The L298N motor driver is utilized for motor speed and direction control.
The Arduino UNO takes instructions from the Bluetooth module (via smartphone app) to move the robot.

Robotic Arm:
Servo SG90 motors are controlled by the joints:
Base rotation
Shoulder movement
Elbow movement
Gripper (open/close)
Arduino sends PWM signals to control the servo positions.

Control System:
User inputs commands via Bluetooth mobile app.
Arduino interprets the commands to move the robot and drive the robotic arm.
ESP32-CAM sends live video so the operator can view the object and help navigate the robot.

Power Management:
A Lithium-ion battery pack supplies power to the motors and Arduino.
A voltage regulator can be utilized to deliver 5V supply for ESP32-CAM and servos.
